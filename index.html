    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) form the technological backbone of critical infrastructure sectors such as transportation, energy, healthcare, and space operations. By integrating computation, networking, and physical processes, CPSs enable intelligent monitoring, automation, and control. However, this seamless integration across cyber and physical systems also introduces unique and often severe cybersecurity risks. Attacks targeting CPSs can manipulate cyber and physical systems through software exploits or hardware-level intrusions, potentially bypassing conventional IT security measures and causing real-world consequences.</p>
    <p>This advanced graduate-level course provides an in-depth examination of the cybersecurity landscape for CPS, with a strong emphasis on both software and hardware security. Students will explore foundational and emerging cybersecurity techniques to secure CPSs against complex, persistent, and multi-vector threats.</p>
    <p>The course incorporates traditional cybersecurity frameworks such as the CIA Triad and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, while extending to emerging solutions involving artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum-enhanced security mechanisms. Students will learn about advanced attack vectors such as quantum-based attacks, hardware trojans, and side-channel attacks, alongside countermeasure design.</p>
    <p>To supplement theory with practice, the course features case studies from multiple CPS domains, such as transportation, smart city, energy, and healthcare, highlighting how cybersecurity approaches must adapt to distinct operational constraints and threat landscapes. These case studies will guide students in generalizing and transferring security practices across diverse CPS implementations.</p>
    <p>This course is ideal for graduate students and professionals seeking advanced expertise at the intersection of complex CPS, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure protection.</p>
